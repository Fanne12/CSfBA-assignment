# CSfBA-assignment
This is the Github repository for the individual assignment for the course Computer Science for Business Analytics. 

The assignment is aimed at implementing a duplicate detection algorithm, with an emphasis on LSH, for Web shop products. 
For this assignment, the programming language Python was used and the code can be found in this repository. 
The code is divided into two files and can be used as follows: the first file is called 'functions.py' and contains all the functions created for the duplictate-detection algorithm. The second file is called 'main.py'. This file can be used to import the dataset and extract the necessary information/features from the dataset. The code in the 'main.py' file can also call on the functions of 'functions.py' to perform the duplicate-detection algorithm, perform the bootstrap evaluation and return the corresponding evaluation measures.
